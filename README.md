# WebAuthExample
A more complete web authentication example in D using SQLite database and password encryption.
The core functionality still matches the [vibe.d example for web-auth](https://github.com/vibe-d/vibe.d/tree/master/examples/web-auth).

This project uses bootstrap, which might be removed in the future for just pure html/css example.
